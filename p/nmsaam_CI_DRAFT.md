<ol>
<li><p>The purpose of this Board conflict of interest policy is to protect the interests of the New Mexico Society of Acupuncture and Asian Medicine, hereafter NMSAAM, when it is contemplating entering into a transaction or arrangement that might benefit the private interests of an officer or director of NMSAAM or might result in a possible excess benefit transaction.</p></li>
<li><p>This policy is intended to supplement, but not replace, any applicable state and federal laws governing conflicts of interest applicable to nonprofit and charitable organizations.</p></li>
<li><p>This policy is also intended to identify “independent” directors.</p></li>
</ol>

<li><p><strong>Financial Interest.</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><p>A financial interest is not necessarily a conflict of interest; and</p></li>

<li><p>A person has a financial interest if the person has, directly or indirectly, through business, investment, or family:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>An ownership or investment interest in any entity with which NMSAAM has a transaction or arrangement,</p></li>

</ol></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><strong>Compensation</strong> includes direct and indirect remuneration as well as gifts or favors that are not insubstantial.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Independent Director.</strong> A director shall be considered “independent” for the purposes of this policy if he or she is “independent” as defined in the instructions for the IRS 990 form or, until such definition is available, the director:</p></li>

<h2 data-number="3.1" id="sec:orgc72dabb"><span class="header-section-number">3.1</span> Duty to Disclose</h2>
<p>In connection with any actual or possible conflict of interest, an interested person must disclose the existence of any financial interest and be given the opportunity to disclose all material facts to the Board or Executive Committee.</p>
<h2 data-number="3.2" id="sec:org5fbab48"><span class="header-section-number">3.2</span> Disclosure of Non-financial Interests</h2>
<p>Directors shall disclose non-financial interests generally in their annual statement, and specifically as individual interests arise; non-financial interests are expected, and shall not be reviewed unless a Board member (including the affected member) requests that the interest be reviewed under the Conflict of Interest Policy.</p>
<h2 data-number="3.3" id="sec:org9462c9b"><span class="header-section-number">3.3</span> Recusal of Self</h2>
<p>Any director may recuse himself or herself at any time from involvement in any decision or discussion in which the director believes he or she has or may have a conflict of interest, without going through the process for determining whether a conflict of interest exists.</p>
<h2 data-number="3.4" id="sec:org0f4360b"><span class="header-section-number">3.4</span> Determining Whether a Conflict of Interest Exists</h2>
<p>After disclosure of the financial interest all material facts will be disclosed and reviewed, including discussion with the interested person. Upon request by a Board member the material facts of a non-financial interest will be reviewed, including discussion with the interested party. Then the potentially conflicted Member shall leave the Board or Executive Committee meeting while the determination of a conflict of interest is discussed and voted upon. The remaining Board or Executive Committee members shall decide if a conflict of interest exists.</p>
<h2 data-number="3.5" id="sec:orgd66ae19"><span class="header-section-number">3.5</span> Procedures for Addressing the Conflict of Interest</h2>
<ol>
<li><p>An interested person may make a presentation at the Board or Executive Committee meeting, but after the presentation, he/she shall leave the meeting during the discussion of, and the vote on, the transaction, arrangement, or other matter involving the possible conflict of interest.</p></li>
<li><p>The Chairperson of the Board or Executive Committee shall, if appropriate, appoint a disinterested person or committee to investigate alternatives to the proposed transaction or arrangement.</p></li>
<li><p>After exercising due diligence, the Board or Executive Committee shall determine whether NMSAAM can obtain with reasonable efforts a more advantageous transaction or arrangement from a person or entity that would not give rise to a financial conflict of interest.</p></li>
<li><p>If a more advantageous transaction or arrangement is not reasonably possible under circumstances not producing a financial conflict of interest, the Board or Executive Committee shall determine by a majority vote of the disinterested directors whether the transaction or arrangement is in NMSAAM’s best interest, for its own benefit, and whether it is fair and reasonable. In conformity with the above determination, it shall make its decision as to whether to enter into the transaction or arrangement.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 data-number="3.6" id="sec:org23624db"><span class="header-section-number">3.6</span> Violations of the Conflicts of Interest Policy</h2>
<ol>
<li><p>If the Board or Executive Committee has reasonable cause to believe a member has failed to disclose actual or possible conflicts of interest, it shall inform the member of the basis for such belief and afford the member an opportunity to explain the alleged failure to disclose.</p></li>
<li><p>If, after hearing the member’s response and after making further investigation as warranted by the circumstances, the Board or Executive Committee determines the member has failed to disclose an actual or possible conflict of interest, it shall take appropriate disciplinary and corrective action.</p></li>
