or Executive Committee.

[3.2]{.header-section-number} Disclosure of Non-financial Interests {#sec:org84c15cd number="3.2"}
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Directors shall disclose non-financial interests generally in their

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After disclosure of the financial interest all material facts will be
disclosed and reviewed, including discussion with the interested person.

party. Then the potentially conflicted Member shall leave the Board or

### [3.5.4]{.header-section-number} Decision by Majority Vote {#sec:org1454e8b number="3.5.4"}

If a more advantageous transaction or arrangement is not reasonably
possible under circumstances not producing a financial conflict of
interest, the Board or Executive Committee shall determine by a majority
vote of the disinterested directors whether the transaction or
arrangement is in NMSAAM's best interest, for its own benefit, and
whether it is fair and reasonable. In conformity with the above
determination, it shall make its decision as to whether to enter into
the transaction or arrangement.
