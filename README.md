# NMSAAM Governance
This site contains governance documents for the New Mexico Society for
Acupuncture and Asian Medicine.

Documents are stored in markdown format, and the markdown file is
considered the authoritative version.

You may obtain the documents with the standard command

    git clone https://github.com/nmsaamgov/nmsaamgov.github.io

Of course, the cool kids use ssh
    
	git clone git@github.com:nmsaamgov/nmsaamgov.github.io.git
