# Lack of Quorum
Three borad members were present at 0901, the chair asked for a quorum
and was informed by the board administrator that there was not a
quorum.

The board administrator stated that Ernest Dole had been contacted and
stated via email that he would attend the meeting.

Because there was not a quorum, the chair instructed the board
administrator to contact the board members to find a mutually
agreeable time at the end of November for the next meeting.

At 0936 there was still not a quorum. The meeting was postponed due to
lack of a quorum; no business was discussed and no action taken.
