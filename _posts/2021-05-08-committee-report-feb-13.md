## Documents Reviewed

The governance committee charter was reviewed, especially Article VI Section 2 regarding process for board elections. The committee agreed to make a small edit to the charter bolding the phrase **by the membership** in Article VI Section 2 Subsection 2 Paragraph 3 of the committee charter. 

### Society By-laws

The committee began a systematic review of the by-laws of The Society. The following changes were agreed upon by the committee:

1. Remove the following from Article II ~~as listed in the Society’s articles of incorporation. The registered agent shall be the current president of the Society, and the registered office shall be the president’s address.~~ 
2. Change Article VI Section III to reflect that the following shall be signatories on the NMSAAM bank account
    1. The President
    2. The Treasurer
    3. *One other board member as designated by the board*

The committee agreed, in general, that a lifetime membership option could benefit The Society and ensure the vibrancy and longevity of The Society. It was agreed that Article V Section III be left as written, to allow the board to set the fee for lifetime members, with the approval of the membership at the annual meeting. The committee agrees that adding language to the lifetime membership category consistent with: *applications for lifetime membership shall be approved by the membership at the annual meeting* 

Committee members will collaborate on a shared/online version of the by-laws in MS Word format. The committee agreed to use the comment, suggestion, and track changes features of MS Word to collaborate on the by-laws prior to the next committee meeting. 

## Recommendations

1. That the (governance) committee lead The Society in following the procedure outlined in the governance committee charter for election of board members and officers at the 2021 annual meeting of The Society. 
2. The committee notes that the version of the by-laws at [https://nmsaamgov.github.io/by_laws.html](https://nmsaamgov.github.io/by_laws.html) is the official version of the by-laws of the society; it is recommended that the markdown/plain-text version in the [GitHub](https://github.com/nmsaamgov/nmsaamgov.github.io/blob/master/by_laws.md) repository be used to programmatically generate copies of the by-laws in other formats, eg MS Word or PDF. 
3. That the committee draft a detailed and written process for proposing by-laws changes; that the process allow for a reasonable comment period by the membership prior to a meeting where changes are approved; and that changes be presented to the membership in a transparent, understandable, and complete manner to the membership for comment.
