## Conclusion and Recommendation

**The New Mexico Society for Acupuncture and Asian Medicine Recommends acupuncturists comply with the following guidelines**

1. [Reopening Guidelines: Doctors of Oriental Medicine](https://cvmodeling.nmhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2020/05/NMMATAssessmentDOMReopening2020_05_20.pdf) *May 20, 2020* provided by the New Mexico Medical Advisory Team (MAT)
2. [CCAOM Guidelines](https://www.asacu.org/wp-content/uploads/CCAOM-Clinic-Infection-Control-Advisory.pdf) *Updated April 30, 2020*
3. [Guide to Infection Prevention for Outpatient Settings: Minimum Expectations for Safe Care](https://www.cdc.gov/hai/settings/outpatient/outpatient-care-guidelines.html) CDC Guidance

As long as acupuncturists follow the above guidelines, including but not limited to:

1. Screening patients for COVID-19 symptoms at time of scheduling, via online or phone screening;
2. *COVID-19 positive cases should not visit the office for treatment until they have been released from isolation using current NM DOH Guidelines for isolation and quarantine;*
3. All providers, staff, and patients wear a mask at all times in clinic; staff and providers should consider the use of N95 or KN95 masks;
4. *Clean and disinfect high-touch surfaces (e.g., doorknobs, light switches, and surfaces in and around toilets in patients' rooms) on a more frequent schedule;*
5. Document increase cleaning and disinfecting procedures as recommended by the CCAOM Guidelines and CDC Guidelines;

the New Mexico Society for Acupuncture and Asian Medicine does not recommend the closing of acupuncturists' clinics solely due to the public health emergency at this time.
