4. Committee assignments and charters

## Documents Reviewed

### Code of Conduct

The committee reviewed the [NMSAAM Code of Conduct](https://nmsaamgov.github.io/coc). 
The committee approves of the code of conduct.

## Recommendations

1. The committee strongly recommends that the NMSAAM listserv be restricted to NMSAAM members only. 
2. The committee recommends that the board instruct all standing committees to adopt a charter. The governance committee members will assist and provide a template charter or outline for other committees to use. 
3. The committee recommends that the finance committee be separate from the governance committee; but that there will understandably be some overlap in membership of the two committees.
