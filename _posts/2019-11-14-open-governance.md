This site is the beginning of a documentation process for the New
Mexico Society for Acupuncture and Asian Medicine. While many of the
documents that will be housed here exist, the format is not standard
and there is no standard authoritative collection of them. 

## Markdown

The documents will be in
[markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)
format. The main advantage of markdown is that it is a plain text
format, this has a number of advantages but the primary ones are:

1. The files can be opened on almost any computer. 
2. It is easy to look at two versions of a file and see what is
   different between them. 

Markdown can also be transformed into other formats, most notably HTML
for displaying on the website and LaTeX for exporting to PDF and
print. One could also use Pandoc to create odt or docx files from the
markdown originals. 

## Governance Should be Open

Documents like the society by-laws and committee charters should be
available to every member or potential member. In addition, it makes
sense to have these documents and procedures available to the general
public for the sake of accountability. 

By hosting the files on github as plain text, anyone may use the
sophisticated mechanisms of github (eg *issues* and *pull requests* to
name a couple) to point out problems, suggest changes, or have
collegial discussions about the documents and their contents. This is
simply not possible to the same degree if the files are in a
word-processor format on a board member's hard drive.
