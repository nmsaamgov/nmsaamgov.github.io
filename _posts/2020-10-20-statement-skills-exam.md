It is the opinion of the New Mexico Society for Acupuncture and
Asian Medicine that: 

**The clinical skills examination specified in Paragraph (2) of
Subsection B of 16.2.4.8 NMAC is both necessary and sufficient to
protect public safety. The New Mexico Society for Acupuncture and
Asian Medicine (NMSAAM) strongly supports the clinical skills
examination as currently administered.**

The exam authorized by the *Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine Practice
Act* and defined in Paragraph (2) of Subsection B of 16.2.4.8 NMAC,
hereafter "the exam", has been a requirement for the practice of
acupuncture in New Mexico since the act was passed in 1981. Since that
time, there have been very few adverse events relating to the practice
of acupuncture in the state. This is, in part, due to the exam
requirement.

The exam as currently administered has been evaluated by outside PhDs
in psychometrics. This was done by the Board of Acupuncture and
Oriental Medicine, "the board", at the board's expense. It was
established that the current exam:

1. Is objective in its testing of licensee candidates; 
2. Tests objectively different criteria than any exams offered by the
   National Certification Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental
   Medicine (NCCAOM). 
   
The practical nature of the exam is similar in scope and rigor to
those required by other health providers, including but not limited to
optometrists and emergency medical technicians (EMT). 

As a matter of high professional standards and public safety, NMSAAM
strongly supports the continued administration of the exam.
