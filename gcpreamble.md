It is in the interest of the New Mexico Society for Acupuncture and Asian Medicine to ensure **all** members are easily able to participate in the governance of the association. 
By codifying information on policy, process, procedures, and actions and preserving that information, the *Governance Committee* seeks to increase transparency, allow more participation, and remove barriers to truly democratic and egalitarian governance of The Society.
