title: NMSAAM Code of Conduct
date:2020-09-27
---

The mission of the New Mexico Society of Acupuncture and Asian
Medicine (NMSAAM) is to promote the profession of acupuncturists and
the inclusion of professional acupuncturists as an integral part of
the health-care system of our communities. A foundational part of that
mission is the promotion of open, profession, and collegial discussion
between acupuncturists.

This Code of Conduct provides an overview of the general rules and
policies that are consistent with the high standards of business
ethics we uphold and emphasizes the value we place on trust and
treating all NMSAAM members and stakeholders with respect. This Code
of Conduct is a great resource, but it does not cover every
situation. It is important to use good judgment in your words and
actions and contact NMSAAM if you’re unsure about the right course of
action. While we encourage a lively exchange of ideas and insights in
face-to-face and online proceedings, we do ask that you read and
adhere to the NMSAAM Code of Conduct when participating in NMSAAM
events and discussions whether online, verbal, written or visual.

## Anti-Harassment and Anti-Discrimination 

In proceedings of the NMSAAM, NMSAAM strives to maintain professional
environments and professional in-person or online interactions where
people are treated with dignity, decency, and respect - an environment
characterized by mutual trust and the absence of intimidation,
oppression, and exploitation. NMSAAM will not tolerate unlawful
discrimination or harassment of any kind. NMSAAM will not tolerate
negative biases and racial stereotypes from any party including staff,
volunteers, speakers, guests, members, contractors, government, and
industry representatives.

### Prohibition Against Hate-Speech

*Hate Speech* is defined as: 

> Any kind of communication in speech, writing or behavior, that
> attacks or uses pejorative or discriminatory language with reference
> to a person or a group on the basis of who they are, in other words,
> based on their religion, ethnicity, nationality, race, color,
> descent, gender or other identity factor

The NMSAAM will not tolerate hate speech of any kind from any party
including staff, volunteers, speakers, guests, members, contractors,
government, and industry representatives.

## Prohibition Against Illegal Conduct

The NMSAAM does not permit the discussion of any actions that violate
the laws of the State of New Mexico or the United States including but
not limited to: 

Discussion of the illegal use or distribution of any substance defined
in the Controlled Substance Act.

Communication about prices or terms of service, to exchange practice
management or any other proprietary information, or otherwise
communicate in a manner that may violate federal or state antitrust
laws.

Posted statements that are offensive and insulting to individuals (or
constituencies or organizations) violate the NMSAAM Code of Conduct
and may violate applicable defamation laws. The term defamation can
include verbal and written statements that are factually
false. Defamation laws are generally intended to protect individuals
and organizations from false factual statements that could harm their
reputations. One key element in proving defamation claims in most
states is that the aggrieved party must establish that the defendant
uttered or published a false factual statement to a third
party. Exercise good judgment and avoid engaging in personal attacks
against others while using the NMSAAM online forums.

NMSAAM proceedings or online forums may not be used in a manner that
violates applicable federal, state, or local laws, including laws
protecting intellectual property. For example, while sources can be
disclosed, participants may not post or distribute files, articles, or
other information subject to trademark, copyright, or other
proprietary rights, except with the express consent of the owner of
the rights.

## General Principles of NMSAAM Online Community and Discussion Forums

1. Maintain online communities that are open, secure, and trustworthy
   for all member participants.
2. Establish fellowship and support among acupuncturists that will
   enhance their care of patients, individuals, and communities. 
3. Cultivate engagement, exchange of information, collaboration, and
   sharing of innovative ideas relevant to acupuncture and Asian
   medicine.

### Rules Applicable to NMSAAM Online Discussion Forums and Lists

   Honor our differences. Fellow online users should always be treated
   with respect, without exception. Discrimination based on age, race,
   ethnicity, national origin, citizenship, disability, marital
   status, religion, sexuality, gender, gender identity, or any other
   legally recognized protected basis under federal, state, or local
   laws, regulations, or ordinances will not be tolerated. We want the
   NMSAAM online communities to be welcoming forums for all
   members. This means that discriminatory statements, both clear and
   masked in words or images, are not appropriate. Harassing,
   bullying, trolling, taunting or defamatory content will also not be
   tolerated.
2. **Communicate in a professional manner**
   Maintain open, honest, and respectful dialogues. Discussions should
   encourage conversation and not create divisiveness or
   tension. Every member deserves the opportunity to express his or
   her opinions on our profession and related matters openly and in a
   civil, respectful manner. Participants should act in a dignified
   and courteous manner to avoid injuring others, their property,
   reputation, or employment by false, malicious or improper
   action. Obscene, vulgar, or inappropriate language and/or images
   are not acceptable and will not be tolerated.
3. **Keep Discussions on Topic** 
   Use of NMSAAM online communities to discuss and debate
   non-health-care: politics, religion, or sexual content is
   prohibited. Posting of political promotions and/or content of
   self-interest is also prohibited.

   honestly, in good faith, and with the highest professional
   standards.

   forums. Preserve, protect, and secure PHI and hold in the highest
   regard health information and other information of a confidential
   nature obtained in an official capacity, taking into account the
   applicable statutes and regulations. Comply with HIPAA
   requirements.Do not disclose any kind of confidential, proprietary,

and guidelines contained in the Code of Conduct at any
time. Participants are expected to check this page from time to time
to take notice of any changes.

## Code of Conduct Violation Policy

The Code of Conduct should not be seen as all-inclusive, but rather to
give our members a general idea of the guidelines one should follow
when participating in NMSAAM communities.

The NMSAAM Board of Directors shall determine, in its sole discretion,
whether there has been a breach of the Code of Conduct and may take
any action deemed appropriate. 

In order to preserve an environment that encourages respectful and
meaningful dialogue, the NMSAAM Board of Directors reserves the right
to remove content and suspend or terminate participation on all lists
for anyone who violates these rules.

The NMSAAM Board of Directors reserves the right to delegate to the
Executive Committee, as defined by the by laws of The Society, or to
any committee of moderators determined by the Board, enforcement of
the Code of Conduct for NMSAAM online communities. 

### Disciplinary Actions for Code of Conduct Violations

1. First and second violation, an email or phone call is communicated
   to the member that explains the violation that occurred. The post
   is removed.
2. The member may be placed in a moderation queue, where messages from
   the member’s account are reviewed before they are posted online.
3. Third violation, a formal letter is sent to the member who violated
   the Code of Conduct. The member is removed from participating in
   the NMSAAM online forum. 
4. Continued or especially egregious violations of the Code of Conduct
   will be referred to the Board of Directors for possible suspension,
   expulsion, or denial of membership according to Article V Section II
   of the by laws of The Society. 
   
### Appeal Process

A member may not appeal removal of a post. A member may appeal their
removal from an NMSAAM online forum by contacting
governance@nmsaam.org in writing. Final decisions will be reviewed and
decided upon by a panel of staff and peers. Appeals should include the
following information:

* First name, last name, email address, phone number
* Full disclosure of any previous violations
* Why you feel the online community removal should be overturned;
  include any relevant or supporting evidence.

Suspension, expulsion, or denial of membership, including appeals,
will be dealt with as defined in Article V Section II of the by laws
of The Society.
